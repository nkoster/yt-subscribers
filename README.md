# yt-subscribers

**Get the number of Youtube subscribers for a specific channel, with a (very) simple shell (bash) script.**

Example:

```
./yt-subscribers https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA
```

results in a JSON object like this:

```
{"time":"1548875491","subscribers":"232160","channel":"bald and bankrupt"}
```

Another example:

```
./yt-subscribers https://www.youtube.com/user/hickok45
```

The script "[mrbald](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkoster/yt-subscribers/master/mrbald)" is filled with some examples:

```

{"time":"1549136478","subscribers":"295342","channel":"Karl Rock"}

**Warning**

Because of the simplicity of the way I parse the result from wget, and/or, not using any API, this thing is suppose to break easily.

Any layout change that Youtube will push to their web site, can stop the script from working correctly.
